    "Create a Python script that simulates trading over a dataset containing historical stock prices. The bot will decide whether to buy, hold, or sell based on the momentum calculated as the difference between the current price and the average price of the last few days.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Structure**:\n",
    "   - Use a list of tuples or dictionaries to simulate historical stock data with each element containing information about the stock price on a particular day.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Momentum Calculation**:\n",
    "   - Calculate the average price of the last N days and compare it with the current day's price to determine the momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Trading Decisions**:\n",
    "   - Use if-else statements to make trading decisions based on the calculated momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Trading Simulation**:\n",
    "   - Loop through the dataset and simulate trading decisions, updating the portfolio accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Performance Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - At the end of the simulation, calculate and print the final portfolio value and compare it with the initial value to gauge performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skills and Python Features Used:\n",
    "- **Python Operators**: Use arithmetic operators to calculate averages, gains, and losses.\n",
    "- **Python if-else**: Make conditional decisions based on momentum and other trading indicators.\n",
    "- **Python Modules**: Use the `datetime` module for handling dates, `matplotlib` for plotting stock prices and portfolio value over time.\n",
    "- **Python While Loop**: Could be used to allow the simulation to run until a certain condition is met, like a stop-loss limit.\n",
    "- **Python for loop**: Iterate over each day in the stock dataset to simulate trading.\n",
