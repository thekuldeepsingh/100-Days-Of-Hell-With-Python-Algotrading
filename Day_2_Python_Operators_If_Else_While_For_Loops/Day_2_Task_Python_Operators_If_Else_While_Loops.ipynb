    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Structure**:\n",
    "   - Use a list of tuples or dictionaries to simulate historical stock data with each element containing information about the stock price on a particular day.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Momentum Calculation**:\n",
    "   - Calculate the average price of the last N days and compare it with the current day's price to determine the momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Trading Decisions**:\n",
    "   - Use if-else statements to make trading decisions based on the calculated momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Trading Simulation**:\n",
    "   - Loop through the dataset and simulate trading decisions, updating the portfolio accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Performance Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - At the end of the simulation, calculate and print the final portfolio value and compare it with the initial value to gauge performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skills and Python Features Used:\n",
    "- **Python Operators**: Use arithmetic operators to calculate averages, gains, and losses.\n",
    "- **Python if-else**: Make conditional decisions based on momentum and other trading indicators.\n",
    "- **Python Modules**: Use the `datetime` module for handling dates, `matplotlib` for plotting stock prices and portfolio value over time.\n",
    "- **Python While Loop**: Could be used to allow the simulation to run until a certain condition is met, like a stop-loss limit.\n",
    "- **Python for loop**: Iterate over each day in the stock dataset to simulate trading.\n",
